## Priprema:
- Mix dry ingredients: 
  - In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
- Mix wet ingredients: 
  - In another bowl or measuring cup, combine milk, oil, and vanilla (if using).
- Combine: 
  - Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. 
  - A few small lumps are fine—don’t overmix.
- Cook: 
  - Preheat your waffle iron and lightly grease if needed. 
  - Pour batter according to your waffle iron’s instructions and cook until golden and crisp (usually 3–5 minutes).
- Serve: Enjoy immediately with maple syrup, fruit, or your favorite toppings.


## Notes:
- For extra fluffiness, let the batter rest 5–10 minutes before cooking.
- This recipe works great with dairy-free milk and oil instead of butter, making it suitable for vegans if you use plant-based ingredients.
