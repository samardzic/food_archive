#### Sastojci
- 300g chicken breast (drained)
- 1 egg
- 1/4 cup parmesan cheese 


#### Toppings:
- 1/3 cup unsweetened pizza sauce
- 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese
- 10-12 slices pepperoni


#### Directions:

- Start by opening your canned chicken and draining. 
    - You will want to get as much moisture out as possible because you want your crust to be crispy. 
    - I even used a clean kitchen towel to get as much water out as possible.
- In a medium sized bowl, add your chicken, cheese and egg.
- Add your crust to a parchment lined baking sheet  
- Bake the crust for 10 minutes at 475 degrees.
Remove crust and your toppings of choice! Bake for another 5-10 minutes. You can broil if you want your cheese super melty
Remove from oven and allow to cool for a few minutes and enjoy!
