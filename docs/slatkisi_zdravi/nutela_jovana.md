#### Uvod

Simply the best low carb chocolate hazelnut spread ever.
This keto Nutella recipe is the stuff of legends. At least in my own mind, but a legend nonetheless.  

#### Sastojci
- 3/4 cup hazelnuts toasted and husked**
- 2 to 3 tbsp melted coconut oil can sub avocado oil
- 2 tbsp cocoa powder
- 2 tbsp powdered Swerve Sweetener
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- Pinch salt

#### Recept
- In a food processor or high powered blender, grind hazelnuts until finely ground and beginning to clump together.
- Add 2 tablespoons oil and continue to grind until nuts smooth out into a butter.
- Add remaining ingredients and blend until well combined. If the mixture is very thick, add an additional tablespoon oil.

#### Recipe Notes

To toast and husk hazelnuts, simply spread on a baking sheet and bake at 170C for 10 minutes.
Then rub the hazelnuts with your fingers (after they cool a bit!) to take of most of the husk.
Some of it will not come off and that's okay, just grind it all up.
